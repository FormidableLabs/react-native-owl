          This visual regression testing for React Native library enables
          developers to introduce visual regression tests to their apps for{' '}
          <strong>iOS</strong> and <strong>Android</strong>. Being heavily
          inspired by <a href="https://wix.github.io/Detox/">Detox</a>, an
          end-to-end testing and automation framework, this library uses a
          similar API that makes setting up react-native-owl and running the
          tests locally and on your preferred CI service, seamless.
