# Work-in-Progress

### Future functionality

- We plan to integrate [Detox](https://wix.github.io/Detox/) into the library, and add methods to our [API](/docs/api/methods) to allow tests to interact with the app. For example, this could allow the particular button to be tapped, or screen to be scrolled, before taking and comparing a screenshot as part of a test.

- We will automate the launching to the relevant simulator, if not already running, when running tests.
