# react-native-owl-demo

> A simple react-native app that uses _react-native-owl_ with examples. Also used for the development of the library.

## Running the app

First, install the dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

### iOS

Install the pods:

```sh
cd ios/ && pod install && cd ..
```

Then run the app:

```sh
yarn ios
```

### Android

Run the app:

```sh
yarn android
```

## Development

To use a local version of react-native-owl, first, navigate to the local directory of react-native-owl(one level up from the current directory) and run the following command:

```sh
# Assuming you are inside react-native-owl - ie. ~/Projects/react-native-owl
npm link
```

Then navigate back to this project and run the following command:

```sh
npm link react-native-owl
```

Now, this example/demo app will be using the local version of react-native-owl.
