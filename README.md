## What is React Native Owl?

React Native Owl is a visual regression testing library for React Native that enables developers to introduce visual regression tests to their apps for iOS and Android. Being heavily inspired by [Detox](https://github.com/wix/Detox), an end-to-end testing and automation framework, this library uses a similar API that makes setting up `react-native-owl` and running the tests locally and on your preferred CI service seamless.

While Detox focuses on end-to-end testing in general, React Native Owl focuses on visual regression testing and helping you catch unexpected changes to the visual appearance of your app over time.
