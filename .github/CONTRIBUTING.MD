Thank you for contributing!

## Development

### Installing dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

### Testing

You will find tests for files colocated with `*.test.ts` suffixes. Whenever making any changes, ensure that all existing tests pass by running `yarn test`.

If you are adding a new feature or some extra functionality, you should also make sure to accompany those changes with appropriate tests.

### Linting and Formatting

Before committing any changes, be sure to do `yarn prettier:check` and `yarn prettier:apply`; this will lint all relevant files using [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) and report on any changes that you need to make.

### Before submitting a PR...

Thanks for taking the time to help us make react-native-owl even better! Before you go ahead and submit a PR, make sure that you have done the following:

- Run the tests using `yarn test`.
- Run lint and flow using `yarn prettier:check` and `yarn prettier:apply`
- Run `yarn changeset`

### Using changesets

Our official release path is to use automation to perform the actual publishing of our packages. The steps are to:

1. A human developer adds a changeset. Ideally this is as a part of a PR that will have a version impact on a package.
2. On merge of a PR our automation system opens a "Version Packages" PR.
3. On merging the "Version Packages" PR, the automation system publishes the packages.

Here are more details:

### Add a changeset

When you would like to add a changeset (which creates a file indicating the type of change), in your branch/PR issue this command:

```sh
$ yarn changeset
```

to produce an interactive menu. Navigate the packages with arrow keys and hit `<space>` to select 1+ packages. Hit `<return>` when done. Select semver versions for packages and add appropriate messages. From there, you'll be prompted to enter a summary of the change. Some tips for this summary:

1. Aim for a single line, 1+ sentences as appropriate.
2. Include issue links in GH format (e.g. `#123`).
3. You don't need to reference the current pull request or whatnot, as that will be added later automatically.

After this, you'll see a new uncommitted file in `.changesets` like:

```sh
$ git status
# ....
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.changeset/flimsy-pandas-marry.md
```

Review the file, make any necessary adjustments, and commit it to source. When we eventually do a package release, the changeset notes and version will be incorporated!

### Creating versions

On a merge of a feature PR, the changesets GitHub action will open a new PR titled `"Version Packages"`. This PR is automatically kept up to date with additional PRs with changesets. So, if you're not ready to publish yet, just keep merging feature PRs and then merge the version packages PR later.

### Publishing packages

On the merge of a version packages PR, the changesets GitHub action will publish the packages to npm.
